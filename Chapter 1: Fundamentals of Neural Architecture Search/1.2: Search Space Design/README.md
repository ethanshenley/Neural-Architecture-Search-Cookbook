# Recipe 1.2: Search Space Design in NAS

This recipe explores different ways to design and implement search spaces for Neural Architecture Search. We'll implement a flexible search space that includes various operations, skip connections, and different cell types.

## What You'll Learn
- How to design modular search spaces
- Different types of operations and connections
- Cell-based vs. macro search spaces
- Search space analysis techniques

## Key Components
1. Operation Space: Different types of convolutions, pooling, etc.
2. Cell Structure: How to combine operations
3. Skip Connections: Adding residual connections
4. Search Space Analysis: Understanding the space size and properties
