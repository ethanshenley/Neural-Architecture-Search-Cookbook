# Recipe 1.5: Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Search (MO-NAS). Instead of optimizing for a single objective like accuracy, we'll optimize for multiple objectives simultaneously using Pareto optimization.

## What You'll Learn
- Multi-objective optimization in NAS
- Pareto frontier calculation
- Trading off between different objectives
- Non-dominated sorting
- Latency and resource estimation

## Key Components
1. Multiple Objectives: Accuracy, latency, model size
2. Pareto Optimization: Finding non-dominated solutions
3. Resource Estimation: Hardware-aware NAS
4. Trade-off Analysis: Visualizing and selecting architectures
