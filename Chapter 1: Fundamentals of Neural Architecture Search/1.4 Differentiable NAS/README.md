# Recipe 1.4: Differentiable Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). Instead of using discrete operations, DARTS relaxes the architecture representation to be continuous, enabling gradient-based optimization.

## What You'll Learn
- Continuous relaxation of architecture search
- Bi-level optimization
- Architecture gradient computation
- Operation mixing

## Key Components
1. Mixed Operation: Weighted sum of operations
2. Cell Architecture: DAG of mixed operations
3. Bi-level Optimization: Alternate between architecture and weight updates
4. Architecture Discretization: Converting continuous to discrete architecture
