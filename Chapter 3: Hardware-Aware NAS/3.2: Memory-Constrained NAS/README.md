# Recipe 3.2: Memory-Constrained Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements Memory-Constrained Neural Architecture Search. We'll optimize architectures to fit within specific memory budgets while maintaining performance.

## What You'll Learn
- Memory usage estimation
- Parameter and activation memory tracking
- Memory-constrained search strategies
- Memory-efficient architectures

## Key Components
1. Memory Estimator: Track memory usage
2. Memory-Aware Search: Stay within budget
3. Activation Memory: Runtime memory needs
4. Parameter Memory: Model size constraints
