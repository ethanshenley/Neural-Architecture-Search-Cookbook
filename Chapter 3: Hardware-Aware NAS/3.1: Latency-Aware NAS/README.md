# Recipe 3.1: Latency-Aware Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements Latency-Aware Neural Architecture Search. Instead of optimizing only for accuracy, we'll incorporate hardware latency predictions into the search process.

## What You'll Learn
- Hardware latency modeling
- Latency-constrained architecture search
- Multi-objective optimization with latency
- Hardware-specific measurements

## Key Components
1. Latency Predictor: Model hardware runtime
2. Latency Database: Cache measured latencies
3. Constrained Search: Meet latency targets
4. Hardware Profiling: Measure real latencies
