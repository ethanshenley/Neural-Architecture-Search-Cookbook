# Recipe 3.5: Platform-Specific Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements Platform-Specific Neural Architecture Search. We'll optimize architectures for different hardware platforms while considering their unique constraints and capabilities.

## What You'll Learn
- Hardware-specific constraints
- Platform-aware operation selection
- Resource utilization optimization
- Cross-platform performance modeling

## Key Components
1. Platform Profiling: Hardware capabilities
2. Resource Modeling: Memory, compute, energy
3. Operation Libraries: Platform-specific ops
4. Hardware Co-design: Architecture-platform matching
