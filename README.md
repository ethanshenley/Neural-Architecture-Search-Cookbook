# Neural Architecture Search Cookbook ðŸ§¬

Welcome to the NAS Cookbook - your comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Neural Architecture Search! This repository provides a structured learning path from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques in automated neural network design.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) represents the next frontier in deep learning, automating the design of neural networks for optimal performance. This cookbook provides:

- Comprehensive theoretical foundations
- Practical implementation recipes
- Real-world deployment considerations
- Hardware-aware optimizations
- Multi-objective trade-off analysis

## ðŸ“š Learning Path

- Introduction to multi-objective optimization

### Chapter 2: Advanced Neural Architecture Search
- One-shot architecture search
- Progressive space exploration
- Neural predictors for performance estimation
- Zero-cost proxies
- Once-for-all networks

### Chapter 3: Hardware-Aware NAS
- Latency-aware architecture search
- Memory-constrained optimization
- Energy-efficient design
- Quantization-aware search
- Platform-specific considerations

### Chapter 4: Application-Specific NAS
- Detection architecture search
- Segmentation-specific design
- GAN architecture optimization
- Transformer search spaces
- Graph neural architecture search

### Chapter 5: Multi-Objective NAS
- Pareto-optimal search
- Constrained optimization
- Preference-based search
- Dynamic trade-offs
- Composite objectives

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethanshenley/Neural-Architecture-Search-Cookbook 
cd Neural-Architecture-Search-Cookbook
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Follow the learning path:
   - Start with Chapter 1's fundamentals
   - Progress through advanced concepts
   - Explore hardware considerations
   - Apply to specific domains
   - Master multi-objective optimization

## ðŸ“– How to Use This Cookbook

Each chapter has an overview README and 5 Recipes.

Start with the overall chapter README, then dive into each recipe! Each one has a README going
over learning objectives and key components. After reading that, dive into the code!

Some code is explicitly not finished so you can take it into you own codebases and 
use your own search spaces easier.
