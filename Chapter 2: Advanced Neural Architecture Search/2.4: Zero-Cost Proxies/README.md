# Recipe 2.4: Zero-Cost Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements Zero-Cost Neural Architecture Search using gradient-based proxies. Instead of training architectures, we use various metrics computed at initialization to predict performance.

## What You'll Learn
- Gradient-based architecture evaluation
- Zero-cost proxy metrics
- Network properties at initialization
- Efficient architecture ranking

## Key Components
1. Proxy Metrics: Gradient-based indicators
2. Network Analysis: Properties at initialization
3. Architecture Scoring: Combining multiple metrics
4. Efficient Search: No training required
