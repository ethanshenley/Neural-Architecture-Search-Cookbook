# Recipe 2.3: Neural Predictor for NAS

This recipe implements a Neural Predictor approach to NAS. Instead of training each architecture or using a simple surrogate model, we use a neural network to predict architecture performance.

## What You'll Learn
- Architecture encoding strategies
- Neural network performance prediction
- Bayesian optimization with neural predictors
- Uncertainty estimation in predictions

## Key Components
1. Architecture Encoder: Convert architectures to vectors
2. Neural Predictor: Performance prediction network
3. Uncertainty Estimation: Predict confidence intervals
4. Acquisition Function: Select promising architectures
