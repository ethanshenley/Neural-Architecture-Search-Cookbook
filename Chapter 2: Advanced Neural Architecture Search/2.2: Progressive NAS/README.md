# Recipe 2.2: Progressive Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements Progressive Neural Architecture Search (PNAS). Instead of searching the entire space at once, PNAS progressively grows architectures from simple to complex while using a surrogate model to predict performance.

## What You'll Learn
- Progressive space exploration
- Performance prediction with surrogate models
- Cell-based architecture search
- Efficient candidate selection

## Key Components
1. Progressive Growth: Start simple, add complexity
2. Surrogate Predictor: Learn to predict performance
3. Cell-based Search: Build architectures from cells
4. Candidate Selection: Choose promising architectures
