# Recipe 4.1: Detection Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements Detection-specific Neural Architecture Search. We'll optimize architectures for object detection tasks, considering multi-scale features and anchor-based detection.

## What You'll Learn
- Detection-specific search spaces
- Multi-scale feature optimization
- Anchor-based architecture design
- Speed-accuracy trade-offs for detection

## Key Components
1. Feature Pyramid: Multi-scale feature extraction
2. Anchor Generation: Scale and aspect ratio optimization
3. Detection Head: Classification and regression branches
4. NMS Optimization: Post-processing efficiency
