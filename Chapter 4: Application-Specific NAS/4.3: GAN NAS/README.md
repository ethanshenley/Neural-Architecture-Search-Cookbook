# Recipe 4.3: GAN Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements GAN-specific Neural Architecture Search. We'll optimize architectures for both generators and discriminators while ensuring training stability.

## What You'll Learn
- GAN-specific search spaces
- Generator architecture optimization
- Discriminator architecture search
- Stability-aware architecture design

## Key Components
1. Generator Search: Upsampling and generation paths
2. Discriminator Search: Downsampling and classification
3. Stability Metrics: Mode collapse prevention
4. Progressive Growing: Resolution-based search
