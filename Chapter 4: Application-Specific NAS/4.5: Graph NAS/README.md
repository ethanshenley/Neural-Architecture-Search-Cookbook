# Recipe 4.5: Graph Neural Network Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements Graph-specific Neural Architecture Search. We'll optimize architectures for graph neural networks, focusing on message passing and aggregation operations.

## What You'll Learn
- Graph-specific search spaces
- Message passing optimization
- Aggregation strategies
- Graph pooling methods

## Key Components
1. Message Functions: Edge feature processing
2. Update Functions: Node feature updates
3. Aggregation: Neighborhood information fusion
4. Pooling: Graph-level representations
