# Recipe 4.2: Segmentation Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements Segmentation-specific Neural Architecture Search. We'll optimize architectures for semantic segmentation tasks, focusing on decoder design and skip connections.

## What You'll Learn
- Segmentation-specific search spaces
- Decoder architecture optimization
- Skip connection patterns
- Resolution-aware design

## Key Components
1. Encoder Path: Feature extraction
2. Decoder Path: Feature reconstruction
3. Skip Connections: Multi-scale fusion
4. Resolution Management: Memory-efficient design
