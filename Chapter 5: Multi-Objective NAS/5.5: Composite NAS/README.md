# Recipe 5.5: Composite Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements Composite Neural Architecture Search. We'll create composite objectives that combine multiple metrics into unified scoring functions.

## What You'll Learn
- Composite objective design
- Metric normalization
- Weighted aggregation
- Hybrid objectives

## Key Components
1. Metric Composition: Combining objectives
2. Score Normalization: Unified scaling
3. Weight Adaptation: Dynamic importance
4. Hybrid Search: Multi-metric optimization
