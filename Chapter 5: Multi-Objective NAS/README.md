# Chapter 5: Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Search

## Introduction to Multi-Objective NAS

Real-world neural architecture deployment requires balancing multiple competing objectives simultaneously. This chapter explores advanced techniques for handling multiple objectives in NAS, from Pareto optimization to dynamic trade-offs.

## Chapter Overview

### Recipe 5.1: Pareto-optimal NAS

- Visualize trade-off surfaces
- Make informed architecture selections

### Recipe 5.2: Constrained NAS
Real-world deployments often come with strict constraints that must be satisfied while optimizing objectives.

**Key Concepts:**
- Hard constraint handling
- Soft constraint relaxation
- Feasibility evaluation
- Constraint-aware search
- Penalty methods

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Handle hard/soft constraints
- Design feasibility checks
- Implement constraint satisfaction
- Balance multiple constraints
- Optimize under restrictions

### Recipe 5.3: Preference-based NAS
Different deployment scenarios have different preferences among objectives, requiring adaptive optimization approaches.

**Key Concepts:**
- Preference modeling
- Interactive optimization
- User feedback integration
- Adaptive preference learning

### Recipe 5.4: Dynamic Trade-off NAS
Real-world requirements often change during deployment, necessitating dynamic adaptation of objective priorities.

**Key Concepts:**

- Context-aware optimization
- Dynamic weight adjustment
- Adaptive constraint handling
- Online learning methods

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Implement dynamic adaptation
- Design context-aware systems
- Handle changing priorities
- Optimize runtime behavior
- Maintain performance bounds

### Recipe 5.5: Composite NAS
Some scenarios benefit from combining multiple objectives into composite metrics while maintaining interpretability.

**Key Concepts:**
- Objective aggregation methods
- Weighted combination strategies
- Scalarization techniques
- Hybrid objective design
- Multi-metric optimization

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Design composite objectives
- Implement weighted combinations
- Handle metric normalization
- Balance multiple metrics
