# Recipe 5.4: Dynamic Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements Dynamic Neural Architecture Search. We'll create architectures that can adapt to changing conditions and requirements at runtime.

## What You'll Learn
- Dynamic adaptation strategies
- Runtime condition monitoring
- Resource-aware switching
- Context-based optimization

## Key Components
1. Runtime Monitor: Resource tracking
2. Context Manager: Condition detection
3. Adaptation Engine: Architecture switching
4. Performance Tracker: Efficiency metrics
