# Recipe 5.2: Constrained Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements Constrained Neural Architecture Search. We'll optimize architectures while satisfying hard and soft constraints on various metrics.

## What You'll Learn
- Hard constraint handling
- Soft constraint relaxation
- Feasibility checking
- Constraint-aware optimization

## Key Components
1. Constraint Types: Hard vs. soft constraints
2. Feasibility Rules: Constraint satisfaction
3. Penalty Methods: Soft constraint handling
4. Search Strategy: Constraint-aware search
