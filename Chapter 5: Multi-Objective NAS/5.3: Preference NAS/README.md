# Recipe 5.3: Preference-based Neural Architecture Search

This recipe implements Preference-based Neural Architecture Search. We'll optimize architectures based on user-defined preferences and priorities.

## What You'll Learn
- Preference modeling
- Interactive search
- Priority handling
- Adaptive sampling

## Key Components
1. Preference Model: User preference encoding
2. Interactive Search: User feedback integration
3. Priority Weights: Objective importance
4. Adaptive Strategy: Preference-guided exploration
